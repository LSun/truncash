Building on [Prof. Matthew Stephens](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/)'s initial observation that under correlation, although the empirical distributions of the test statistics are different from their theoretical marginal one, correlation affacts test statistics unevenly.  Moderate observations, defined as $|\hat\beta / \hat s| \leq t$ with a pre-specified $t$, are more prone to correlation and thus contain less information to control false discoveries than extreme ones, `truncash` makes partial use of moderate observations, combined with full use of extreme ones, for adaptive empirical Bayes shrinkage.
