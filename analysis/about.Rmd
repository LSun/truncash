Building on Matthew's insight that moderate observations, defined as $|\hat\beta / \hat s| \leq t$ with a pre-specified $t$, are more prone to correlation and thus contain less information to control false discoveries than extreme ones, `truncash` makes partial use of moderate observations, combined with full use of extreme ones, to adaptively shrink the measurements with heteroskedastic noise.
