## Introduction

We apply Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg's FDR-controlling procedure, `ash`, and `truncash` (with the threshold $T = 1.96$) to the simulated, correlated null data, obtained from 5 vs 5 GTEx/Liver samples and 10K top expressed genes, and $1000$ independent simulation trials.  We compare the numbers of false discoveries (by definition, all discoveries will be false) obtained by these three methods, under FDR $\leq 0.05$ and $s$-value $\leq 0.05$ as cutoffs.
